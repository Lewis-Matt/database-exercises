Write SELECT statements to output each of the following with a caption:

    All albums in your table.
    All albums released before 1980
    All albums by Michael Jackson

    After each SELECT add an UPDATE statement to:

    Make all the albums 10 times more popular (sales * 10)
    Move all the albums before 1980 back to the 1800s.
    Change 'Michael Jackson' to 'Peter Jackson'

    Add SELECT statements after each UPDATE so you can see the results of your handiwork.
