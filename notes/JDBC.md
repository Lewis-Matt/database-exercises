# Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC)
Standard Java API for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a wide range of databases.

The JDBC library includes APIs for each of the tasks mentioned below that are commonly associated with database usage.

1. Making a connection to a database.
2. Creating SQL or MySQL statements.
3. Executing SQL or MySQL queries in the database.
4. Viewing & Modifying the resulting records.


A database driver is a program that translates between Java and the database server. Database drivers are specific to a DBMS, meaning you would need a different database driver to talk to MySQL than you would to talk to Microsoft SQL Server.
